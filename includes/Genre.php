                                <p>Action fiction is the literary genre that includes spy novels, adventure stories, tales of terror and intrigue (cloak and dagger) and mysteries. This kind of story utilizes suspense, the tension that is built up when the reader wishes to know how the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist is going to be resolved or what the solution to the puzzle of a thriller is.</p>

                                <p>Children's literature, often known as juvenile literature, consists of stories, books, magazines, and poems written specifically for children. Modern children's literature is divided into two categories: genre and target reader age. Children's literature can be traced back to stories and songs that adults shared with children before publication existed as part of a larger oral tradition. It is difficult to trace the evolution of early children's literature before the invention of printing. Even when printing became common, many great children's stories were written for adults and later adapted for a younger audience.</p>

                                <p>Comics are visuals that are used to represent narratives or other ideas, frequently in conjunction with the text. It usually takes the shape of a series of image panels. Textual elements like speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can be used to represent conversation, narration, sound effects, or other information. The size and layout of panels add to the pacing of the narrative. The most frequent image-making methods in comics are cartooning and other forms of illustration; fumetti is a technique that incorporates photographic pictures. Comic strips, editorial and joke cartoons, and comic books are all common genres.</p>
