                        <p>
                            Yes, absolutely! With BPE, many of those who began their writing careers through self-publication have gone on to find a home in traditional publication houses. Our team of designers, marketers, distributors, and editors is working collectively to help bring your book to the next level and hopefully an even greater audience. We will help you navigate through the market and ensure that your book gets the right exposure and sale in the traditional structure.
